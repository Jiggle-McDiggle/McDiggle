    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>At McDiggle Corporation, we take innovation seriously, just not ourselves. Founded on a groundbreaking idea (which we've since forgotten), McDiggle Corp. has grown into a proudly huge entity, delivering high-quality nothing.</p>
    <p>Our team is made up of world-class thinkers, part-time philosophers, and full-time snack-eaters, all united by a shared goal: to keep doing whatever it is we do, but always better.</p>
    <p>Whether you're here for business, curiosity, or because you clicked the wrong link, welcome. We're glad you made it. Stay as long as you'd like.</p>
